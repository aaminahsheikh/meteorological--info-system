# Meteorological Info System


A fully functional Web App built with Django to store weather info, weather warnings and different operations on stored data.


As a junior developer, I automate the manual weather sharing information between 2 departments by designing and building web app using Django as back-end & Postgres & front-end using HTML, CSS & Bootstrap. This Web App reduced the manpower for transferring information from one department to another and also saved a lot of time.
